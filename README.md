# Not Alone

A Minecraft Mod that adds a subtle Herobrine to the game.

The mod is designed to be installed and forgotten about, as it's intent is to make the player question if what they saw was actually there or if they imagined it.

Currently has this main feature, but it will have more in the future that will follow the same concept.

## Multiplayer

The mod also works in multiplayer and needs to be installed on both the server and client.

The mod will choose a player at random every 20 minutes, during this period it's possible for Herobrine to appear in relation to the player, while being mindful of other players as well.

This mod is particularly good if added to a modpack given to a friend or group of friends without them knowing, allowing for a potentially real and genuine unsettling experience that they will not be able to explain, since the mod is subtle and not explicitly horror.
